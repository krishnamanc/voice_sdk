# Voice SDK

## Overview
This SDK allows developers to create voice bots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal latency. It converts speech to text, queries an LLM, converts the LLM response to speech, and streams audio back to the user.

## Setup

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure your API keys in `config.py`.

## Usage

To run the application, execute:
'''
python main.py
'''
